        <div class="content">
          <p>According to the International Research Centre for Women, almost 47 percent of girls are married before the age
            of 18. Currently, India ranks 13 in the world when it comes to child marriages. Since child marriage has been
            steeped into the Indian culture and tradition since centuries, it has been tough eliminating it. The Prohibition
            of Child Marriage Act was made effective in 2007. This act defines child marriage as a marriage where the groom
            or the bride are underage, that is, the bride is under 18 years of age or the boy is younger than 21 years.
            Parents trying to marry underage girls are subject to action

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">&#43    Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>According to this act, taking or giving of dowry at the time of the marriage to the bride or the bridegroom and
            their family is to be penalised. Dowry system, giving and taking of dowry, is a norm in India. Dowry is often
            asked of the bride and her family by the groom and his family. The system has taken strong roots because women
            after marriage move in with their spouse and in-laws. Also, over the centuries, the lack for economic
            independence of women and the taboo towards divorce has resulted in bride burning. When demands for dowry even
            after marriage are not met by the girl&#39s families, many women are tortured, beaten and even burnt. It is one
            of the major challenges that our society is grappling with. Women openly complaining about it has helped to
            spread the word and encourage other women to take a stand.
